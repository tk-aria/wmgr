# Project Implementation Guidelines

## Development Process
- Implement features by referencing features.md from top to bottom
- Continue processing until all items are completed
- Unimplemented items are marked with []
- Mark completed items with [x]
- Compile and check for errors after each individual [] item
- Git add and commit commands can be executed directly without additional confirmation

## Reporting and Documentation
- Always report executed commands in summary.md
- For each task or interruption:
  - Log all operations in docs/report/[task name]/summary.md
  - Commit work differences to git
- If errors occur:
  - Create docs/report/[task name]/troubleshooting.md
  - Document actual error content and resolution steps

## Additional Guidelines
- If encountering the same error 3 times, stop work and summarize the situation
